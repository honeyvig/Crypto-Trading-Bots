The ideal candidate will have a strong background in machine learning, quantitative modeling, and algorithmic trading, combined with a deep understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets.
------------------
To design and develop an AI system for cryptocurrency trading, you’ll need a blend of machine learning (ML), quantitative modeling, and algorithmic trading techniques. Below is an outline for how you can approach building a cryptocurrency trading AI system in Python, along with sample code for key components such as data collection, preprocessing, model building, and backtesting.
Key Steps to Build the System:

    Data Collection:
        Gather historical cryptocurrency price data using APIs like Binance, CoinGecko, or CryptoCompare.
        Gather real-time data for live trading and backtesting.

    Data Preprocessing:
        Normalize or standardize the data to make it suitable for machine learning models.
        Create relevant features (e.g., moving averages, volatility indicators, RSI, etc.).

    Model Building:
        Use machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, or deep learning models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for time series forecasting.
        You can also use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to build an agent that can learn and make decisions based on reward signals.

    Backtesting:
        Use backtesting libraries like Backtrader to evaluate your strategy on historical data.

    Deploying the Model:
        Deploy the model for real-time trading using APIs to execute buy/sell orders.

Tools and Libraries:

    Binance API or CCXT for cryptocurrency data collection.
    Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
    Scikit-learn or XGBoost for traditional machine learning models.
    TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models.
    Backtrader for backtesting.
    ccxt for exchange trading.

Example Python Code:

Below is a basic example that focuses on data collection, preprocessing, and training a simple model for cryptocurrency trading. The model will predict price movement (up/down), and you can extend it for more complex strategies.
1. Install Required Libraries:

pip install ccxt pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow backtrader

2. Data Collection from Binance:

We'll use the CCXT library to fetch historical price data from Binance:

import ccxt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def fetch_data(symbol='BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=500):
    exchange = ccxt.binance()
    data = exchange.fetch_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe=timeframe, limit=limit)
    
    # Convert to a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
    return df

# Example: Fetch 500 hours of BTC/USDT data
data = fetch_data(symbol='BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=500)
print(data.head())

3. Feature Engineering:

For feature engineering, let's compute a simple Moving Average (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for this example.

def add_technical_indicators(df):
    # Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    df['SMA_20'] = df['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

    # Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    df['EMA_20'] = df['close'].ewm(span=20, adjust=False).mean()

    # Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    delta = df['close'].diff()
    gain = delta.where(delta > 0, 0)
    loss = -delta.where(delta < 0, 0)
    
    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=14).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=14).mean()
    
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    df['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    
    return df

# Add technical indicators to the data
data = add_technical_indicators(data)
print(data.tail())

4. Train a Machine Learning Model:

Now, let's build a machine learning model that predicts whether the price will go up or down based on technical indicators. We'll use Logistic Regression as a simple classifier.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def prepare_data(df):
    df = df.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
    df['target'] = np.where(df['close'].shift(-1) > df['close'], 1, 0)  # 1 if price goes up, else 0
    features = ['SMA_20', 'EMA_20', 'RSI']
    X = df[features]
    y = df['target']
    return X, y

# Prepare data for training
X, y = prepare_data(data)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')

5. Backtesting:

We'll use Backtrader for backtesting the strategy. This library allows you to define custom strategies and evaluate them over historical data.

import backtrader as bt

class CryptoStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    # Define indicators
    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data.close, period=20)
        self.rsi = bt.indicators.RelativeStrengthIndex(period=14)
        self.order = None

    def next(self):
        if self.order:
            return  # Prevent duplicate orders

        # Simple strategy: Buy when RSI is below 30 (oversold), sell when above 70 (overbought)
        if self.rsi < 30:
            self.order = self.buy()
        elif self.rsi > 70:
            self.order = self.sell()

# Backtest the strategy
def run_backtest(data):
    cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
    cerebro.addstrategy(CryptoStrategy)

    # Convert the pandas DataFrame to Backtrader data feed
    data_feed = bt.feeds.PandasData(dataname=data)
    cerebro.adddata(data_feed)

    # Set initial cash and commission
    cerebro.broker.set_cash(10000)
    cerebro.broker.set_commission(commission=0.001)

    # Run the backtest
    cerebro.run()

    # Plot the results
    cerebro.plot()

# Run backtest on the fetched data
run_backtest(data)

6. Deploying the Model for Real-time Trading:

For real-time trading, you can connect the trained model to an exchange's API (e.g., Binance or Kraken) and use it to make buy/sell decisions based on real-time data. You can periodically fetch data, preprocess it, and feed it into your model for predictions.

Here’s a brief overview of how to integrate the model with live trading:

def live_trading(model, exchange, symbol='BTC/USDT'):
    while True:
        # Fetch real-time data (e.g., 1-minute data)
        data = fetch_data(symbol=symbol, timeframe='1m', limit=20)
        data = add_technical_indicators(data)
        
        # Make prediction using the model
        X_live = data[['SMA_20', 'EMA_20', 'RSI']].iloc[-1:].values
        prediction = model.predict(X_live)
        
        # If prediction is 1 (buy), place buy order
        if prediction == 1:
            exchange.create_market_buy_order(symbol, amount_to_buy)
        elif prediction == 0:
            exchange.create_market_sell_order(symbol, amount_to_sell)
        
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 1 minute before the next prediction

Conclusion:

The code provided includes essential components for building a cryptocurrency trading AI system. It handles data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model training. Additionally, it sets up backtesting using Backtrader for simulating the trading strategy. You can integrate real-time trading features with exchanges like Binance using the CCXT library. Depending on the complexity of your trading strategy, you can enhance this further using deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) or Reinforcement Learning techniques for more advanced decision-making.
